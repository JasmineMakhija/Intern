# Internschools+
In this project, I have created a website named Internschool+ where University students looking for Internship opportunities where they can easily look for short-term/long-term internships in 
the domain of their choice. 
Also, I have created the chat-with-us page using azure bot services where a chatbot can easily guide them with their queries. And a registration page for easy registration. In the end, I deployed this web app using Azure static web app service through github.
Steps followed
1. Created a chatbot using azure bot services(Kindly Check the chat with us page in my website)
2.Deployed my website using azure static web app services
As I have got the azure for students with 100USD dollers so i was able to created those resources using azure services
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!ðŸ˜Š
